# MTGCardSorter

Eventually a physical machine that can sort cards based on a criteria. Currently just a card scanner (Identifies set code and name using OCR on processed images of cards). As of 3/16, ignoring vintage border cards, two cards on one, double sided cards, 93% accuracy scanning using perfect images. Still working on image preprocessing of actual photos, hard to test because I don't have an adequate camera.
